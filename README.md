<h1>1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.</h1>


<h4>Based on the provided context, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship where a product is associated with a single product category, but a product category can have multiple products associated with it. This is because the "Product" table has a "category_id" field that refers to the "id" field in the "Product_Category" table. However, the "Product_Category" table does not have any direct reference to the "Product" table, which is why we can infer that a product category can have many products.</h4>



<h1>2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?</h1>

<h4>To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we could implement a foreign key constraint between the "category_id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This would ensure that any attempt to insert a product into the "Product" table with an invalid or non-existent "category_id" would result in an error.

Additionally, we could also implement a trigger on the "Product" table that checks the validity of the "category_id" before inserting a new product record. The trigger could perform a lookup in the "Product_Category" table to ensure that the specified "category_id" exists before allowing the insert to proceed.

Another approach could be to use application-level validation, where the application code checks the validity of the "category_id" before inserting a new product record into the database. This approach can be more flexible and allows for more complex validation rules, but it also requires more development effort and may introduce additional complexity and maintenance overhead.<h4>
